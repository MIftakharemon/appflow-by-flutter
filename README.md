## 💡 Why This Project?

As a developer passionate about productivity tools, I wanted to build something that addresses the limitations I’ve experienced using popular tools like Notion—especially around **data privacy**, **native experience**, and **flexibility**.

This project is my attempt to give back to the open-source community by building a robust, extensible, and privacy-first workspace tool that:

- Offers powerful, Notion-like functionality
- Prioritizes **data ownership** and **offline-first** capability
- Enables custom apps through **modular building blocks**
- Provides a **cross-platform native experience** using Flutter and Rust

Whether you are an individual, a startup, or a hacker, this tool is here to empower you.
